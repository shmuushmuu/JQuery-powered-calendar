## Description of Project
The project was to make a day-planner that would interact with real-time, save a to-do list to local storage, and repopulate the text areas upon refresh.
Most of the html was already provided, and the CSS was not to be touched. I learned to use JQuery in a hands-on manner, and I'm in love. If I saw JQuery on J-Swipe, I'd function (swipeRight).

I was able to wrap all of my JS in one function, which kept the page dynamic. It was enjoyable to accomplish my goal, while frustrating at times of struggle (like every project). I was able to find myself more assuredly searching for answers to questions in addition to asking questions of my fellow classmates. The more I learn about this field, the more I love the developer community.

## Visuals
The day-planner should look like this:
